### User Accounts ###

    Note: Predefined Oracle accounts which are locked are not included in
    this report. To include all user accounts, run the report with the -a
    option.

* User Accounts *
User Name      Status Profile Tablespace Oracle Defined Auth Type
-------------- ------ ------- ---------- -------------- ---------
C##DONGHUA     OPEN   DEFAULT USERS            No       PASSWORD 
C##REMOTE_USER OPEN   DEFAULT USERS            No       PASSWORD 
SYS            OPEN   DEFAULT SYSTEM          Yes       PASSWORD 
SYSTEM         OPEN   DEFAULT SYSTEM          Yes       PASSWORD 

* User Schemas in SYSTEM or SYSAUX Tablespace *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    No user data is stored in SYSTEM and SYSAUX tablespace by default.
Remarks:
    The SYSTEM and SYSAUX tablespaces are reserved for Oracle-supplied user
    accounts. To avoid a possible denial of service caused by exhausting
    these resources, regular user schemas should not use these tablespaces.
References:
    Oracle Database 12c STIG  v1 r10: Rule SV-75949r2, SV-75951r3

* Sample Schemas *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    No sample schemas found.
Remarks:
    Sample schemas are well-known accounts provided by Oracle to serve as
    simple examples for developers. They generally serve no purpose in a
    production database and should be removed because they unnecessarily
    increase the attack surface of the database.
References:
    CIS Oracle Database 12c Benchmark v2.0.0: Recommendation 1.3
    Oracle Database 12c STIG  v1 r10: Rule SV-76167r3

* Inactive Users *
Status: Low Risk
Summary:
    Found 4 user accounts that would remain open even if inactive. Found 2
    unlocked users inactive for more than 30 days.
Details:
    Users with unlimited INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME: C##DONGHUA, C##REMOTE_USER,
        SYS, SYSTEM
    Inactive users: C##REMOTE_USER, SYS
Remarks:
    If a user account is no longer in use, it increases the attack surface
    of the system unnecessarily while providing no corresponding benefit.
    Furthermore, unauthorized use is less likely to be noticed when no one
    is regularly using the account. Accounts that have been unused for more
    than 30 days should be investigated to determine whether they should
    remain active. A solution is to set INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME in the
    profiles assigned to users to automatically lock accounts which have
    not logged in to the database instance in a specified number of days.
    It is also recommended to audit infrequently used accounts for
    unauthorized activities.
References:
    Oracle Database 12c STIG  v1 r10: Rule SV-76207r2

* Users with Expired Passwords *
Status: Low Risk
Summary:
    Found 1 unlocked user with password expired for more than 30 days.
Details:
    Users with expired passwords: SYS
Remarks:
    Password expiration is used to ensure that users change their passwords
    on a regular basis. If a user's password has been expired for more than
    30 days, it indicates that the user has not logged in for at least that
    long. Accounts that have been unused for an extended period of time
    should be investigated to determine whether they should remain active.

* Case-Sensitive Passwords *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Case-sensitive passwords are used.
Details:
    SEC_CASE_SENSITIVE_LOGON=TRUE
Remarks:
    Case-sensitive passwords are recommended because including both upper
    and lower-case letters greatly increases the set of possible passwords
    that must be searched by an attacker who is attempting to guess a
    password by exhaustive search. Setting SEC_CASE_SENSITIVE_LOGON to TRUE
    ensures that the database distinguishes between upper and lower-case
    letters in passwords.
References:
    CIS Oracle Database 12c Benchmark v2.0.0: Recommendation 2.2.12

* Users with Default Passwords *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    No unlocked user accounts are using default password.
Remarks:
    Default passwords for predefined Oracle accounts are well known and
    provide a trivial means of entry for attackers. Well-known passwords
    for locked accounts should be changed as well.
References:
    CIS Oracle Database 12c Benchmark v2.0.0: Recommendation 1.2
    Oracle Database 12c STIG  v1 r10: Rule SV-76031r1, SV-76339r1

* Minimum Client Authentication Version *
Status: Low Risk
Summary:
    Minimum client version is not configured correctly.
Details:
    SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER is not set (default value = 12).
        Recommended value is 12a.
Remarks:
    Over time, Oracle releases have added support for increasingly secure
    versions of the algorithm used for password authentication of user
    accounts. In order to remain compatible with older client software, the
    database continues to support previous password versions as well. The
    sqlnet.ora parameter ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER determines the
    minimum password version that the database will accept. For maximum
    security, this parameter should be set to the highest value supported
    by the database once all client systems have been upgraded.
References:
    Oracle Database 12c STIG  v1 r10: Rule SV-76025r2

* Password Verifiers *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    All user accounts are authenticated using the latest password verifier
    version.  No user accounts have HTTP verifiers.
Details:
    Database supports password versions up to 12c.
    Users authenticated using the prior weaker password verifiers: (none)

    Users with HTTP verifiers: (none)
Remarks:
    For each user account, the database may store multiple verifiers, which
    are hashes of the user password. Each verifier supports a different
    version of the password authentication algorithm. Every user account
    should include a verifier for the latest password version supported by
    the database so that the user can be authenticated using the latest
    algorithm supported by the client. When all clients have been updated,
    the security of user accounts can be improved by removing the obsolete
    verifiers. HTTP password verifiers are used for XML Database
    authentication. Use the ALTER USER command to remove these verifiers
    from user accounts that do not require this access.

* User Parameters *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Examined 2 initialization parameters. No issues found.
Details:
    SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=3
    RESOURCE_LIMIT=TRUE
Remarks:
    SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS configures the maximum number of failed
    login attempts in a single session before the connection is closed.
    This is independent of the user profile parameter
    FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS, which controls locking the user account after
    multiple failed login attempts.
    Not controlling failed login attempts before closing the connection and
    locking accounts after a number of failed logins, opens the door for
    successful brute-force login attacks and the occurrence of Denial-of-
    Service.
    RESOURCE_LIMIT should be set to TRUE to enable enforcement of any
    resource constraints set in user profiles.

* Users with Unlimited Password Lifetime *
Status: Low Risk
Summary:
    Password expiration is configured for all users. Found 4 users with no
    limits on password reuse. Found 4 users with no minimum time before
    password reuse. All user accounts will lock after password expiration.
Details:
    PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME:
    Profiles with limited password lifetime: DEFAULT (180 days),
        ORA_STIG_PROFILE (60 days)
    Profiles with unlimited password lifetime: (none)
    Users with unlimited password lifetime: (none)

    PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX:
    Profiles with limits on password reuse: ORA_STIG_PROFILE (10 times)
    Profiles without limits on password reuse: DEFAULT
    Users without limits on password reuse: C##DONGHUA, C##REMOTE_USER,
        SYS, SYSTEM

    PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME:
    Profiles with minimum time before password reuse: ORA_STIG_PROFILE (365
        days)
    Profiles without minimum time before password reuse: DEFAULT
    Users without minimum time before password reuse: C##DONGHUA,
        C##REMOTE_USER, SYS, SYSTEM

    PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME:
    Profiles with locking after password expiration: DEFAULT (7 days),
        ORA_STIG_PROFILE (5 days)
    Profiles without locking after password expiration: (none)
    Users without locking after password expiration: (none)
Remarks:
    Password expiration is used to ensure that users change their passwords
    on a regular basis. It also provides a mechanism to automatically
    disable temporary accounts. Passwords that never expire may remain
    unchanged for an extended period of time. When passwords do not have to
    be changed regularly, users are also more likely to use the same
    passwords for multiple accounts.

* Account Locking after Failed Login Attempts *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    User accounts are configured to prevent brute force password attacks by
    locking the account after a number of failed login attempts. User
    accounts are configured to stay locked for a minimum duration after
    being locked due to failed login attempt.
Details:
    FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS:
    Profiles with limited failed login attempts: DEFAULT (10),
        ORA_STIG_PROFILE (3)
    Profiles with unlimited failed login attempts: (none)
    Users with unlimited failed login attempts: (none)

    PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME:
    Profiles with minimum lock time: DEFAULT (1 day)
    Profiles without minimum lock time: ORA_STIG_PROFILE
    Users without minimum lock time: (none)
Remarks:
    Attackers sometimes attempt to guess a user's password by simply trying
    all possibilities from a set of common passwords. To defend against
    this attack, it is advisable to use the FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS and
    PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME profile resources to lock user accounts for a
    specified time when there are multiple failed login attempts without a
    successful login.

* Password Verification Functions *
Status: Medium Risk
Summary:
    Found 4 users not using password verification function.
Details:
    Profiles with password verification function: ORA_STIG_PROFILE
        (ORA12C_STIG_VERIFY_FUNCTION)
    Profiles without password verification function: DEFAULT
    Users without password verification function: C##DONGHUA,
        C##REMOTE_USER, SYS, SYSTEM
Remarks:
    Password verification functions are used to ensure that user passwords
    meet minimum requirements for complexity, which may include factors
    such as length, use of numbers or punctuation characters, difference
    from previous passwords, etc. Oracle supplies several predefined
    functions, or a custom PL/SQL function can be used. Every user profile
    should include a password verification function.

    (*) = granted with admin option
    (D) = granted directly
    (C) = granted commonly
Remarks:
    System privileges provide the ability to access data or perform
    administrative operations for the entire database. Consistent with the
    principle of least privilege, these privileges should be granted
    sparingly. The Privilege Analysis feature may be helpful to determine
    the minimum set of privileges required by a user or role. In some
    cases, it may be possible to substitute a more limited object privilege
    grant in place of a system privilege grant that applies to all objects.
    System privileges should be granted with admin option only when the
    recipient needs the ability to grant the privilege to others.

* All Roles *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted roles via 22
    grants.
Details:
    Users directly or indirectly granted each role:

    AQ_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE: SYSTEM
    CAPTURE_ADMIN: SYSTEM
    DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE: SYSTEM
    DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE: SYSTEM
    DBA: SYSTEM
    EM_EXPRESS_ALL: SYSTEM
    EM_EXPRESS_BASIC: SYSTEM
    EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE: SYSTEM
    EXP_FULL_DATABASE: SYSTEM

    SCHEDULER_ADMIN: SYSTEM
    SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE: SYSTEM
    WM_ADMIN_ROLE: SYSTEM
    XDBADMIN: SYSTEM
    XDB_SET_INVOKER: SYSTEM
Remarks:
    Roles are a convenient way to manage groups of related privileges,
    especially when the privileges are required for a particular task or
    job function. Beware of broadly defined roles, which may confer more
    privileges than an individual recipient requires. Privilege Analysis
    can be used to determine specific privileges that the recipient
    actually requires. Roles should be granted with admin option only when
    the recipient needs the ability to modify the role or grant it to
    others.

* Code Based Access Control *
Status: Medium Risk
Summary:
    Code Based Access Control (CBAC) enabled for 2 Program Units.
Details:
    Following Program Units are granted CBAC Roles:

    SYS.DBMS_MDX_ODBO: DBMS_MDX_INTERNAL
    Users with execute privilege: PUBLIC

    GSMADMIN_INTERNAL.EXCHANGE: DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE,
        DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE
    Privileges granted via CBAC role: CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, ALTER
        DATABASE, ALTER PROFILE, ALTER RESOURCE COST, ALTER USER, AUDIT
        ANY, AUDIT SYSTEM, CREATE PROFILE, CREATE SESSION, DELETE ANY
        TABLE, EXECUTE ANY OPERATOR, GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY
        PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE, SELECT ANY TABLE
    PUBLIC is granted Execute on Program Units via CBAC Role.
Remarks:
    Code Based Access Control (CBAC) can be used to grant additional
    privileges on program units like PL/SQL functions, procedures, or
    packages. CBAC allows you to attach database roles to a PL/SQL
    function, procedure, or package. These database roles are enabled at
    run time, enabling the program unit to execute with the required
    privileges in the calling user's environment.

* Account Management Privileges *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted account
    management privileges via 13 grants.  No grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of ALTER USER, CREATE USER, DROP USER:

    SYSTEM <- DBA: ALTER USER, CREATE USER, DROP USER
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE: ALTER USER
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: ALTER
        USER, CREATE USER, DROP USER
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EM_EXPRESS_ALL: ALTER USER, CREATE USER, DROP USER
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: ALTER USER, CREATE USER, DROP USER

Remarks:
    Account management privileges (ALTER USER, CREATE USER, DROP USER) can
    be used to create and modify other user accounts, including changing
    passwords. This ability can be abused to gain access to another user's
    account, which may have greater privileges. Users with Account
    management privileges should be audited.

* Role and Privilege Management Privileges *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted role and
    privilege management privileges via 25 grants.  No grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of ALTER ANY ROLE, CREATE ROLE, DROP ANY ROLE, GRANT ANY OBJECT
        PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE:

    SYSTEM <- DBA: ALTER ANY ROLE, CREATE ROLE, DROP ANY ROLE, GRANT ANY
        OBJECT PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE: GRANT ANY OBJECT
        PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE:
        CREATE ROLE, DROP ANY ROLE, GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY
        PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EM_EXPRESS_ALL: ALTER ANY ROLE, CREATE ROLE, DROP ANY
        ROLE, GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY
        ROLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: CREATE ROLE, DROP ANY ROLE, GRANT
        ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE

Remarks:
    Users with role and privilege management privileges (ALTER ANY ROLE,
    CREATE ROLE, DROP ANY ROLE, GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY
    PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE) can change the set of roles and privileges
    granted to themselves and other users. This ability should be granted
    sparingly, since it can be used to circumvent many security controls in
    the database. The Privilege Analysis feature may be helpful to
    determine whether a user or role have used privilege management
    privileges.

* Database Management Privileges *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted database
    management privilege via 13 grants.  No grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of ALTER DATABASE, ALTER SYSTEM, CREATE ANY LIBRARY, CREATE
        LIBRARY, DROP ANY LIBRARY:

    SYSTEM <- DBA: ALTER DATABASE, ALTER SYSTEM, CREATE ANY LIBRARY, CREATE
        LIBRARY, DROP ANY LIBRARY
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE: ALTER DATABASE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: ALTER
        DATABASE, CREATE ANY LIBRARY, DROP ANY LIBRARY
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EM_EXPRESS_ALL: ALTER SYSTEM
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: ALTER DATABASE, CREATE ANY LIBRARY,
        DROP ANY LIBRARY

Remarks:
    Database management privileges (ALTER DATABASE, ALTER SYSTEM, CREATE
    ANY LIBRARY, CREATE LIBRARY, DROP ANY LIBRARY) can be used to change
    the operation of the database and potentially bypass security
    protections. CREATE LIBRARY allows a user to create or replace a
    library. This ability should be granted only to trusted administrators
    and should be sufficiently audited.

* Audit Management Package *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted EXECUTE on
    Audit management packages via 6 grants.  No grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of EXECUTE on DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT:

    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE <-
        EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE: EXECUTE on DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE <-
        EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE: EXECUTE on DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE <-
        EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE: EXECUTE on DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE: EXECUTE on DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE: EXECUTE on
        DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE: EXECUTE on
        DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT

Remarks:
    The DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT package is used to execute Audit Trail management
    procedures and functions. Users with the execute privilege can invoke
    subprograms like CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL that deletes audit trail records or
    files that have been archived. Access should be strictly limited and
    granted only to users with a legitimate need for this functionality.

* Audit Management Privileges *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted privilege to
    manage audit policies via 8 grants.  No grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of AUDIT ANY, AUDIT SYSTEM:

    SYSTEM <- DBA: AUDIT ANY, AUDIT SYSTEM
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE: AUDIT ANY, AUDIT SYSTEM
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: AUDIT
        ANY, AUDIT SYSTEM
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: AUDIT ANY, AUDIT SYSTEM

Remarks:
    Audit management privileges (AUDIT ANY, AUDIT SYSTEM) can be used to
    add, drop and modify the audit policies for the database. This ability
    should be granted sparingly, since it may be used to hide malicious
    activity. The Privilege Analysis feature may be helpful to determine
    whether the audit management privileges have been used by a user or
    role. Users with these privileges should be sufficiently audited.

* Broad Data Access Privileges *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted broad data
    access privileges via 39 grants.  No grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of SELECT ANY TABLE, READ ANY TABLE, INSERT ANY TABLE, DELETE
        ANY TABLE, ALTER ANY TABLE, UPDATE ANY TABLE, CREATE ANY TRIGGER,
        ALTER ANY TRIGGER, CREATE ANY INDEX, CREATE ANY PROCEDURE, SELECT
        ANY DICTIONARY:

    SYSTEM: SELECT ANY TABLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA: ALTER ANY TABLE, ALTER ANY TRIGGER, CREATE ANY INDEX,
        CREATE ANY PROCEDURE, CREATE ANY TRIGGER, DELETE ANY TABLE, INSERT
        ANY TABLE, READ ANY TABLE, SELECT ANY DICTIONARY, SELECT ANY TABLE,
        UPDATE ANY TABLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE:
        SELECT ANY TABLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE: DELETE ANY TABLE, SELECT
        ANY TABLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE:
        SELECT ANY TABLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: ALTER
        ANY TABLE, ALTER ANY TRIGGER, CREATE ANY INDEX, CREATE ANY
        PROCEDURE, CREATE ANY TRIGGER, DELETE ANY TABLE, INSERT ANY TABLE,
        SELECT ANY TABLE, UPDATE ANY TABLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE: SELECT ANY TABLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: ALTER ANY TABLE, ALTER ANY TRIGGER,
        CREATE ANY INDEX, CREATE ANY PROCEDURE, CREATE ANY TRIGGER, DELETE
        ANY TABLE, INSERT ANY TABLE, SELECT ANY TABLE, UPDATE ANY TABLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- OLAP_DBA: DELETE ANY TABLE, INSERT ANY TABLE, SELECT
        ANY TABLE, UPDATE ANY TABLE

Remarks:
    Users with broad data access privileges (SELECT ANY TABLE, READ ANY
    TABLE, INSERT ANY TABLE, DELETE ANY TABLE, ALTER ANY TABLE, UPDATE ANY
    TABLE, CREATE ANY TRIGGER, ALTER ANY TRIGGER, CREATE ANY INDEX, CREATE
    ANY PROCEDURE, SELECT ANY DICTIONARY) have very broad access to data
    stored in any schema. Most administrative tasks do not require access
    to the data itself, so these privileges should be granted rarely even
    to administrators. Users with direct object privileges on tables that
    holds sensitive data should also be reviewed. In addition to minimizing
    grants of these privileges, consider the use of Database Vault realms
    to limit the use of these privileges to access sensitive data stored in
    user schemas.
    Also, the Privilege Analysis feature may be helpful to restrict the use
    of broad data access privileges required by a user or role. In some
    cases, it may be possible to substitute a more limited object privilege
    grant in place of a system privilege grant that applies to all objects.
    System privileges should be granted with admin option only when the
    recipient needs the ability to grant the privilege to others.

* Access Control Exemption Privileges *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted access
    control exemption privileges via 3 grants.  No grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY, EXEMPT REDACTION POLICY:

    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE:
        EXEMPT REDACTION POLICY
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE:
        EXEMPT REDACTION POLICY
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE: EXEMPT REDACTION POLICY

Remarks:
    Users with access control exemption privileges (EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY,
    EXEMPT REDACTION POLICY) can bypass the row and column access control
    policies enforced by Virtual Private Database and Data Redaction,
    respectively. Most administrative tasks do not require access to the
    data itself, so these privileges should be granted rarely even to
    administrators. Users with these privileges should be sufficiently
    audited.

* Access to Password Verifier Tables *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    No users granted read on dictionary tables containing password
    verifiers No grants to PUBLIC.
Remarks:
    Users with READ, SELECT and UPDATE privileges on dictionary tables
    containing verifiers can access and modify user password verifiers. The
    verifiers can be used in offline attacks to discover user passwords.

* Write Access to Restricted Objects *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted object
    privileges on Oracle Database restricted objects via 48 grants.  No
    grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE on SYS, DVSYS, AUDSYS or LBACSYS
        objects:

    SYSTEM <- DBA: INSERT on SYS.XSDB$SCHEMA_ACL, UPDATE on
        SYS.XSDB$SCHEMA_ACL
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE:

    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE: DELETE on SYS.INCEXP, DELETE on
        SYS.INCFIL, DELETE on SYS.INCVID, INSERT on SYS.INCEXP, INSERT on
        SYS.INCFIL, INSERT on SYS.INCVID, UPDATE on SYS.INCEXP, UPDATE on
        SYS.INCFIL, UPDATE on SYS.INCVID
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- GATHER_SYSTEM_STATISTICS: DELETE on SYS.AUX_STATS$,

        SYS.OPT_CALIBRATION_STATS$, INSERT on SYS.OPT_CALIBRATION_STATS$,
        UPDATE on SYS.OPT_CALIBRATION_STATS$

Remarks:
    Users with these privileges can directly modify objects in the SYS,
    DVSYS, AUDSYS or LBACSYS schemas. Manipulating these system objects may
    allow security protections to be circumvented or otherwise interfere
    with normal operation of the database. PUBLIC must not be granted
    access to objects in SYS, DVSYS, AUDSYS and LBACSYS schemas. When
    running a Privilege Analysis Capture, be aware of privileges that have
    been granted to access objects in any Oracle-created schemas. Review
    the grants for relevance.

* Access to Audit Objects *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted object
    privileges on audit objects via 7 grants.  No grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of SELECT, DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE on AUDIT objects:

    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE <-
        SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE: SELECT on SYS.AUDTAB$TBS$FOR_EXPORT_TBL
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE <-
        SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE: SELECT on SYS.AUDTAB$TBS$FOR_EXPORT_TBL
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE <-
        SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE: SELECT on SYS.AUDTAB$TBS$FOR_EXPORT_TBL
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EM_EXPRESS_ALL <- EM_EXPRESS_BASIC <-
        SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE: SELECT on SYS.AUDTAB$TBS$FOR_EXPORT_TBL
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- EXP_FULL_DATABASE <- SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE: SELECT on
        SYS.AUDTAB$TBS$FOR_EXPORT_TBL
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE: SELECT on
        SYS.AUDTAB$TBS$FOR_EXPORT_TBL
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE: SELECT on
        SYS.AUDTAB$TBS$FOR_EXPORT_TBL

Remarks:
    Users with these privileges can directly access and modify objects
    containing audit information. Access to these objects may allow a
    malicious user deduce privilege settings for other users and to
    manipulate the audit information by replacing or deleting audit
    records.
    Use Privilege Analysis to identify used and unused access to these
    privileges. Instead of granting a default role with many privileges

    contain the necessary system and object privileges the user or role
    needs to perform the task.

* User Impersonation Privilege *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted user
    impersonation privilege via 3 grants.  No grants to PUBLIC. No users
    granted EXECUTE on restricted packages that can be executed with the
    identity of some other user No grants to PUBLIC.
Details:
    Grants of BECOME USER:

    SYSTEM <- DBA: BECOME USER
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- DATAPUMP_IMP_FULL_DATABASE <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE:
        BECOME USER
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: BECOME USER

Remarks:
    The BECOME USER privilege and some PL/SQL packages (DBMS_AQADM_SYS,
    DBMS_AQADM_SYSCALLS, DBMS_IJOB, DBMS_PRVTAQIM, DBMS_REPCAT_SQL_UTL,
    DBMS_SCHEDULER, DBMS_STREAMS_ADM_UTL, DBMS_STREAMS_RPC, DBMS_SYS_SQL,
    INITJVMAUX, LTADM, WWV_DBMS_SQL, WWV_EXECUTE_IMMEDIATE) allow for
    execution of SQL code or external jobs using the identity of a
    different user. Access should be strictly limited and granted only to
    users with a legitimate need for this functionality. Use Privilege
    Analysis to identify used and unused access to these privileges. Users
    with BECOME USER privilege and EXECUTE privilege on above packages
    should be sufficiently audited.

* Data Exfiltration *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    No users granted EXECUTE on restricted packages that can be used for
    data exfiltration.  No grants to PUBLIC.
Remarks:
    Some PL/SQL packages (DBMS_BACKUP_RESTORE, UTL_DBWS, UTL_ORAMTS) can
    send data from the database using the network or file system. Access
    should be granted only to users with a legitimate need for this
    functionality. Use Privilege Analysis to identify if these privileges
    were used. If not, consider revoking.

* System Privileges Granted to PUBLIC *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    No grants to PUBLIC.
Remarks:
    Privileges granted to PUBLIC are available to all users. This generally
    should include few, if any, system privileges since these will not be
    needed by ordinary users who are not administrators.

* Roles Granted to PUBLIC *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    PUBLIC has not been granted any role.
Remarks:
    Roles granted to PUBLIC are available to all users. Most roles contain
    privileges that are not appropriate for all users. Use Privilege
    Analysis to identify if these privileges were used. If not, work with
    Oracle support and/or application provider to revoke them if possible.

* Column Privileges Granted to PUBLIC *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    No grants to PUBLIC.
Remarks:
    Privileges granted to PUBLIC are available to all users. This should
    include column privileges only for data that is intended to be
    accessible to everyone.

* Users with Administrative SYS* Privileges *
Status: Low Risk
Summary:
    Found 2 users granted administrative SYS* privileges. Found 3
    administrative SYS* privileges not granted to any user.
Details:
    SYSDBA    (1): SYS
    SYSOPER   (2): C##REMOTE_USER, SYS
    SYSBACKUP (0): (none)
    SYSDG     (0): (none)
    SYSKM     (0): (none)
Remarks:
    Administrative SYS* privileges allow a user to perform maintenance
    operations, including some that may occur while the database is not
    open. The SYSDBA privilege allows the user to run as SYS and perform
    virtually all privileged operations. Starting with Oracle Database
    12.1, less powerful administrative privileges were introduced to allow
    users to perform specific  administrative tasks with less than full
    SYSDBA privileges. To achieve the benefit of this separation of duty,
    each of these administrative privileges should be granted to at least
    one named user account.

* Users with DBA Role *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    1 out of 4 users have been directly or indirectly granted highly
    sensitive DBA role via 1 grant.
Details:
    Grants of DBA role:

    SYSTEM: DBA

Remarks:
    The DBA is a powerful role and can be used to bypass many security
    controls. It should be granted to a small number of trusted
    administrators.
    As a best practice, it is recommended to create custom DBA-like roles
    with minimum set of privileges that users require to execute their
    tasks (least privilege principle) and do not grant the DBA role.
    Privilege Analysis can assist in the task of identifying used/unused
    privileges and roles.
    Having different roles with minimum required privileges based on types
    of operations DBAs execute also helps to achieve Separation of Duties.
    Furthermore, each trusted user should have an individual account for
    accountability reasons. It is recommended to audit users with the DBA
    roles to detect any unauthorized activity. Avoid granting the DBA or
    custom DBA-like powerful roles WITH ADMIN option unless absolutely
    necessary.
    Please note that Oracle may add or remove roles and privileges from the
    DBA role.

        SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE
    SYSTEM <- DBA <- IMP_FULL_DATABASE: EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE,
        SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE

    (*) = granted with admin option
Remarks:
    DBA and other similarly powerful roles (AQ_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE,
    EM_EXPRESS_ALL, EXP_FULL_DATABASE, IMP_FULL_DATABASE,
    SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE, EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE, DELETE_CATALOG_ROLE,
    OEM_MONITOR, DBA) contain powerful privileges that can be used to
    bypass security protections. They should be granted only to a small
    number of trusted administrators. It is recommended to audit users with
    these roles to detect any unauthorized activity. Use Privilege Analysis
    to identify if these privileges were used. If not, consider revoking.

Remarks:
    Java permission grants control the ability of database users to execute
    Java classes within the database server. A database user executing Java
    code must have both Java security permissions and database privileges
    to access resources within the database. These resources include
    database resources, such as tables and PL/SQL packages, operating
    system resources, such as files and sockets, Oracle JVM classes, and
    user-loaded classes. Make sure that these permissions are limited to
    the minimum required by each user. Use Privilege Analysis to identify
    if these privileges were used. If not, consider revoking.

### Authorization Control ###

* Database Vault *
Status: Advisory
Summary:
    Database Vault is not enabled.
Remarks:
    Database Vault provides for configurable policies to control the
    actions of database accounts with elevated privileges such as those
    accounts used by administrative users, applications and utilities.
    Attacks (originating from external as well as internal sources)
    leverage privileged account credentials to access sensitive
    information. Database Vault realms prevent unauthorized access to
    sensitive data objects, even by user accounts with system privileges.
    Database Vault Command rules limit the accidental or malicious
    execution of SQL commands. You can use Database Vault to enforce
    separation of duties to prevent a single all powerful user.  Also it
    provides trusted paths to further restrict access to sensitive data
    using system factors such as IP address, program name, time of day and
    user name.
     Database Vault operations control can be used to restrict common users
    from accessing pluggable database (PDB) local data in autonomous,
    regular Cloud, or on-premises environments.

* Privilege Analysis *
Status: Advisory
Summary:
    No Privilege Analysis policies found.
Details:
    Users who can start the privilege analysis capture process: SYSTEM
Remarks:
    Privilege Analysis records the privileges used during a real or
    simulated workload. After collecting data about the privileges that are
    actually used, this information can be used to revoke privilege grants
    that are no longer needed or to create roles with only the privileges
    that are used by the user or role. This helps in implementing Least
    Privileged Model and allows to minimize risk involved in using unused
    or lesser used privileges granted to a user.

### Fine-Grained Access Control ###

* Data Redaction *
Status: Advisory
Summary:
    No data is being dynamically redacted.
Details:

    Users not impacted by Data Redaction Policies: SYSTEM
    Users who can create or manage Data Redaction Policies:  SYSTEM
Remarks:
    Data Redaction automatically masks sensitive data found in the results
    of a database query. The data is masked immediately before it is
    returned as part of the result set, so it does not interfere with any
    conditions specified as part of the query. Access by users with the
    EXEMPT REDACTION POLICY privilege will not be affected by the redaction
    policy. Users who can execute the DBMS_REDACT package are able to
    create and modify redaction policies. Also consider the use of Oracle
    Data Masking and Subsetting to permanently mask sensitive data when
    making copies for test or development use.

    EU GDPR 2016/679: Article 6, 25, 32, 34, 89; Recital 28, 29, 78, 156

* Virtual Private Database *
Status: Advisory
Summary:
    No VPD policies found that automatically limit access to certain rows
    and/or columns based upon the user or the database environment.
Details:

    Users not impacted by VPD Policies: (none)
    Users who can create or manage VPD Policies: SYSTEM
Remarks:
    Virtual Private Database (VPD) allows for fine-grained control over
    which rows and columns of a table are visible to a SQL statement.
    Access control using VPD limits each database session to only the
    specific data it should be able to access. Access by users with the
    EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY privilege will not be affected by VPD policies.
    Users who can execute the DBMS_RLS package are able to create and
    modify these policies.
References:
    EU GDPR 2016/679: Article 29, 32

* Real Application Security *
Status: Advisory
Summary:
    No RAS policies found.
Details:

    Users not impacted by RAS Policies: (none)
    Users who can create or manage RAS policies: DBSFWUSER, SYSTEM, SYSTEM
Remarks:
    Like Virtual Private Database, Real Application Security (RAS)
    introduced in Oracle 12c Release 1, provides fine-grained control over
    the rows and columns of a table that are visible to a SQL statement.
    RAS data access policies uses a declarative syntax based on access
    control lists. Access by users with the EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY privilege
    will not be affected by RAS access policies. Users with
    ADMIN_SEC_POLICY and APPLY_SEC_POLICY privileges are able to create and
    modify these policies.
References:
    EU GDPR 2016/679: Article 6, 25, 32, 34, 89; Recital 28, 29, 64, 78,
    156

* Label Security *
Status: Advisory
Summary:
    Label Security is not enabled.
Remarks:
    Oracle Label Security uses row level data classifications to enforce
    access controls restricting users to only the data they are allowed to
    access. Access to sensitive data is controlled by comparing the data
    label with the requesting user's label or security clearance. A user
    label or security clearance can be thought of as an extension to
    standard database privileges and roles. Access by users with the EXEMPT
    ACCESS POLICY privilege will not be affected by the Label Security
    policies. Each policy has a corresponding role; users who have this
    role are able to administer the policy.
References:
    EU GDPR 2016/679: Article 18, 29, 32; Recital 67

* Transparent Sensitive Data Protection (TSDP) *
Status: Advisory
Summary:
    No data tagged with sensitive types found.  Found 0 TSDP policy.
Details:
    Policies: (none)

    Users with EXECUTE on SYS.DBMS_TSDP_MANAGE: (none)
    Users with EXECUTE on SYS.DBMS_TSDP_PROTECT: (none)
Remarks:
    Transparent Sensitive Data Protection (TSDP), introduced in Oracle
    Database 12c Release 1 Enterprise Edition, allows a data type(such as
    Credit Card number) to be associated with each column that contains
    sensitive data. TSDP can then apply various data security features such
    as Data Redaction or Virtual Private Database to all instances of that
    particular type so that protection is uniform and consistent. Data from
    columns marked as sensitive is also automatically redacted in the
    database audit trail and trace logs. Users who can execute the
    DBMS_TSDP_MANAGE and DBMS_TSDP_PROTECT packages are able to manage
    sensitive data types and the protection actions that are applied to
    them.

### Auditing ###

* Audit Records *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    Examined 3 audit trails. Found records in 1 audit trail. No errors
    found in audit initialization parameters.
Details:
    Traditional Audit Trail: No records found
    FGA Audit Trail: No records found
    Unified Audit Trail: In use, 329 records found (Oct 18 2019 - Nov 24
        2019)

    AUDIT_FILE_DEST=/u01/app/oracle/admin/orcl/adump
    AUDIT_SYSLOG_LEVEL is not set.
    AUDIT_TRAIL=DB
Remarks:
    Auditing is an essential component for monitoring the activities on any
    system including the activities of highly privileged users. Oracle
    Database 12c introduced Unified Auditing that centralizes audit logs in
    a single unified audit trail, and simplifies audit policy management,
    and is the recommended auditing mode moving forward. The
    AUDIT_FILE_DEST controls the OS directory to which the audit trail is
    written if using AUDIT_TRAIL=os, xml, or xml,extended. This directory
    should be prevented from any unauthorized access. Sending audit data to
    a remote system is recommended in order to prevent any possible local
    tampering with the audit records. The AUDIT_SYSLOG_LEVEL parameter can
    be set to send an abbreviated version of audit records to a remote
    syslog collector. A better solution is to use Oracle Audit Vault and
    Database Firewall to centrally collect full audit records from multiple
    databases.

* Audit User Logon / Logoff *
Status: Medium Risk
Summary:
    Database connections are not fully audited.
Details:
    Auditing not enabled: LOGOFF

    Traditional audit - disabled.
    Unified audit - auditing enabled: LOGON
Remarks:
    Successful user connections to the database should be audited to assist
    with forensic analysis. Unsuccessful connection attempts can provide
    early warning of an attacker's attempt to gain access to the database.
    Auditing the LOGOFF time helps understand how long the session was
    active, and is useful information for forensics.

    user. Traditional audit policies do not apply to SYS, so the
    AUDIT_SYS_OPERATIONS parameter must be set to record SYS actions to a
    separate audit trail. Beginning with Oracle 12c, the same Unified Audit
    policies can be applied to SYS that are used to monitor other users.

* Roles Audit *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    No Audit Policy enabled on roles.
Remarks:
    When you audit a role, Oracle Database audits all system privileges
    that are directly granted to the role. Users granted these roles will
    be audited for the system privileges granted to the role.

* Privilege Usage Audit *
Status: Medium Risk
Summary:
    Usages of powerful system privileges are not fully audited.
Remarks:
    Usage of powerful system privileges should always be audited. Each
    privilege listed here should be included in at least one enabled audit
    policy.

* Fine Grained Audit *
Status: Advisory
Summary:
    No fine grained audit policies found.
Details:

    Users with EXECUTE on SYS.DBMS_FGA: SYSTEM
Remarks:
    Fine Grained Audit policies can record specific activity, such as
    access to particular table with sensitive columns or access that occurs
    under specified conditions. This is an effective useful way to monitor
    unexpected data access while avoiding unnecessary audit records that
    correspond to normal activity.

### Encryption ###

* Transparent Data Encryption *
Status: Advisory
Summary:
    Found 7 unencrypted tablespaces. No encrypted columns found. Examined 1
    initialization parameter.
Details:
    Unencrypted tablespaces: SYSAUX, SYSTEM, TEMP, TS1, TS2, UNDOTBS1,
        USERS
    Encrypted tablespaces: (none)

    ENCRYPT_NEW_TABLESPACES=CLOUD_ONLY. Recommended value is ALWAYS in the
        Oracle Cloud or in an on-premise database.
Remarks:
    Encryption of sensitive data is a requirement in most regulated
    environments. Transparent Data Encryption automatically encrypts data
    as it is stored and decrypts it upon retrieval. This protects sensitive
    data from attacks that bypass the database and read data files
    directly. Encryption keys may be stored in wallets on the database
    server itself, or stored remotely in Oracle Key Vault for improved
    security. The ENCRYPT_NEW_TABLESPACES parameter ensures that TDE
    tablespace encryption is applied to all newly created tablespaces.
    Setting this parameter to ALWAYS is recommended in order to protect all
    data regardless of the options specified when the tablespace is
    created.

Summary:
    Found 3 wallets. No wallets are stored in the data file directory.
Details:

    Encryption wallet location:
    Wallet type: FILE
    Status: CLOSED
    Keystore type: UNKNOWN
    Wallet order: SINGLE

    Data file directory: +DATA/dbs
Remarks:
    Wallets are encrypted files used to store encryption keys, passwords,
    and other sensitive data. Wallet files should not be stored in the same
    directory with database data files, to avoid accidentally creating
    backups that include both encrypted data files and the wallet
    containing the master key protecting those files. For maximum
    separation of keys and data, consider storing encryption keys in Oracle
    Key Vault instead of wallet files.

* Access to Dictionary Objects *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Access to dictionary objects is properly limited.
Remarks:
    When O7_DICTIONARY_ACCESSIBILITY is set to FALSE, tables owned by SYS
    are not accessible through the ANY TABLE system privileges. This
    parameter should always be set to FALSE because tables owned by SYS
    control the overall state of the database and should not be subject to
    manipulation by users with ANY TABLE privileges.

* Inference of Table Data *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Data inference attacks are properly blocked.
Details:
    SQL92_SECURITY=TRUE
Remarks:
    When SQL92_SECURITY is set to TRUE, UPDATE and DELETE statements that
    refer to a column in their WHERE clauses will succeed only when the
    user has the privilege to SELECT from the same column. This parameter
    should be set to TRUE so that this requirement is enforced in order to
    prevent users from inferring the value of a column which they do not
    have the privilege to view.

* Access to Password File *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    The password file is configured correctly.
Details:
    REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE=EXCLUSIVE
Remarks:
    The REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE set to EXCLUSIVE allows the password file
    to contain distinct entries for each administrative user allowing them
    to be individually audited and tracked for their actions. It also
    allows passwords to be updated using the ALTER USER command.
References:
    Oracle Database 12c STIG  v1 r10: Rule SV-75921r2

* Network Communication *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Examined 4 initialization parameters. No issues found.
Details:
    REMOTE_LISTENER=''
    SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION=(DROP,3)
    SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION=TRACE
    SEC_RETURN_SERVER_RELEASE_BANNER=FALSE
Remarks:
    REMOTE_LISTENER allows a network listener running on another system to
    be used. This parameter should normally be unset to ensure that the
    local listener is used. The SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR parameters control the
    database server's response when it receives malformed network packets
    from a client. Because these malformed packets may indicate an
    attempted attack by a malicious client, the parameters should be set to
    log the incident and terminate the connection.
    SEC_RETURN_SERVER_RELEASE_BANNER should be set to FALSE to limit the
    information that is returned to an unauthenticated client, which could
    be used to help determine the server's version number and thus the
    vulnerabilities.

* External OS Authorization *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Examined 3 initialization parameters. No issues found.
Details:
    REMOTE_OS_AUTHENT=FALSE
    REMOTE_OS_ROLES=FALSE
    OS_ROLES=FALSE
Remarks:
    The OS_ROLES parameter determines whether roles granted to users are
    controlled by GRANT statements in the database or by the database
    server's operating system. REMOTE_OS_AUTHENT and REMOTE_OS_ROLES allow
    the client operating system to set the database user and roles. All of
    these parameters should be set to FALSE so that the authorizations of
    database users are managed by the database itself.

* Trace Files *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Examined 0 initialization parameter. No issues found.
Remarks:
    The hidden parameter _TRACE_FILES_PUBLIC determines whether trace files
    generated by the database should be accessible to all OS users. Since
    these files may contain sensitive information, access should be limited
    by setting this parameter to FALSE.

* Instance Name Check *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Instance name does not contain database version number.
Details:
    Instance Name = orcl
    Database Version = 19.5.0.0.0
Remarks:
    Instance names should not contain Oracle version numbers. Service names
    may be discovered by unauthenticated users. If the service name
    includes version numbers or other database product information, a
    malicious user may use that information to develop a targeted attack.

* Triggers *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Found 1 logon trigger. No disabled triggers found.
Details:
    Logon triggers: SYS.DBMS_SET_PDB(ENABLED)
Remarks:
    A trigger is code that executes whenever a specific event occurs, such
    as inserting data in a table or connecting to the database. Disabled
    Oracle provided triggers could be a potential cause for concern because
    whatever protection or monitoring they may be expected to provide is
    disabled.

* Disabled Constraints *
Status: Low Risk
Summary:
    Found 1 disabled constraint.
Details:
    Disabled constraints: STS_CHUNKS on GSMADMIN_INTERNAL.SHARD_TS
Remarks:
    Constraints are used to enforce and guarantee specific relationships
    between data items stored in the database. Disabled constraints are a
    potential cause for concern because the conditions they ensure are not
    enforced.

* External Procedures *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    Found 5 external procedures. No external services found.
Details:
    External procedures: MDSYS.SDO_GEOR_GDAL_LIB, ORDSYS.ORDIMLIBS,
        SYS.DBMSHADOOPLIB, SYS.DM$RQEXTLIB, SYS.KUBSAGT_LIB

Remarks:
    External procedures allow code written in other languages to be
    executed from PL/SQL. Note that modifications to external code cannot
    be controlled by the database. Be careful to ensure that only trusted
    code libraries are available to be executed. Although the database can
    spawn its own process to execute the external procedure, it is
    advisable to configure a listener service for this purpose so that the
    external code can run as a less-privileged OS user. The listener
    configuration should set EXTPROC_DLLS to identify the specific shared
    library code that can be executed rather than using the default value
    ANY.

* Directory Objects *
Status: Medium Risk
Summary:
    Found 15 directory objects. Found 1 directory object allowing access to
    restricted Oracle directory paths. No directory objects allow both
    write and execute access.
Details:
    Directory Name: DATA_PUMP_DIR
    Path = /u01/app/oracle/admin/orcl/dpdump/
    Users or roles with access: EXP_FULL_DATABASE(READ),

    Directory Name: XSDDIR
    Path = /u01/db/rdbms/xml/schema/


    Access to $ORACLE_HOME: ORACLE_HOME
Remarks:
    Directory objects allow access to the server's file system from PL/SQL
    code within the database. Access to files that are used by the database
    kernel itself should not be permitted, as this may alter the operation
    of the database and bypass its access controls.

* Database Links *
Status: Low Risk
Summary:
    Found 1 database link. Database link names may not be same as remote
    database connection they define.
Details:
    GLOBAL_NAMES=FALSE

    Users with CREATE DATABASE LINK privilege: SYSTEM
    Users with CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK privilege: SYSTEM

    Private links:
    SYS: SYS_HUB

Remarks:
    Database links allow users to execute SQL statements that access tables
    in other databases. This allows for both querying and storing data on
    the remote database. It is advisable to set GLOBAL_NAMES to TRUE in
    order to ensure that link names match the databases they access.

* Network Access Control *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    Found 2 network ACLs.
Details:
    NETWORK_ACL_86B64B66DF95012EE053F706E80A06B7 (Host: *, Ports: Min -
        Max)
    Principal: ORACLE_OCM, Action: deny, Privilege: resolve

    Principal: ORACLE_OCM, Action: deny, Privilege: resolve
    Principal: GGSYS, Action: deny, Privilege: resolve
    Principal: GSMADMIN_INTERNAL, Action: deny, Privilege: resolve

Remarks:
    Network ACLs control the external servers that database users can
    access using network packages such as UTL_TCP and UTL_HTTP.
    Specifically, a database user needs the connect privilege to an
    external network host computer if he or she is connecting using the
    UTL_TCP, UTL_HTTP, UTL_SMTP, and UTL_MAIL utility packages. To convert
    between a host name and its IP address using the UTL_INADDR package,
    the resolve privilege is required. Make sure that these permissions are
    limited to the minimum required by each user.

Remarks:
    XML ACLs control access to database resources using the XML DB feature.
    Every resource in the Oracle XML DB Repository hierarchy has an
    associated ACL. The ACL mechanism specifies a privilege-based access
    control for resources to principals, which are database users or roles.
    Whenever a resource is accessed, a security check is performed, and the
    ACL determines if the requesting user has sufficient privileges to
    access the resource. Make sure that these privileges are limited to the
    minimum required by each user.

* Database Backup *
Status: Medium Risk
Summary:
    Found RMAN Backup Utility Usage.
Details:
    Last Full Backup was taken on Sun Nov 24 2019 08:00:00.
    Last Log Backup was taken on Sun Nov 24 2019 08:00:00.
    No Backups were created on Tape using Oracle Secure Backup in the last
        90 days.
    Found 21 Unencrypted Backup Pieces out of total 21 Backup Pieces made
        in last 90 days.
Remarks:
    Database should be backed up regularly to prevent loss of data in the
    event of a system failure. Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) allows
    performing backup and recovery tasks on your databases. Unencrypted
    backup data should not be transported on tape or disk to offsite
    storage for  safekeeping. Oracle Secure Backup(OSB) may also be used
    for tape data protection in distributed environment.

### Network Configuration ###

* Network Encryption *
Status: Medium Risk
Summary:
    Native encryption is accepted but not required. Integrity check using
    checksums is accepted but not required.
Details:
    SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER is not set (default value = ACCEPTED).
    SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_SERVER is not set (default value = ACCEPTED).

    Examined 1 listener.

    LISTENER: IPC (1), TCP (1), TCPS (0)

    SSL_CERT_REVOCATION is not set (default value = NONE).
Remarks:
    Network encryption protects the confidentiality and integrity of
    communication between the database server and its clients. Either
    Native Encryption or TLS should be configured to ensure that the
    connections from clients are encrypted. For Native Encryption, both
    ENCRYPTION_SERVER and CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_SERVER should be set to REQUIRED.
    For ease of deployment and compatibility, Oracle Database servers and
    clients are set to ACCEPT encrypted connections out of the box. This
    means that you can enable the desired encryption and integrity settings
    for a connection pair by configuring just one side of the connection,
    server-side or client-side. So, for example, if there are many Oracle
    clients connecting to an Oracle database instance, you can configure
    the required encryption and integrity settings for all these
    connections by making the appropriate sqlnet.ora changes at the server
    end. You do not need to implement configuration changes for each client
    separately. However, in this case, the risk of having plaintext data
    passed over the network still exists. Keep in mind that whether the
    security service is enabled or not it is based on a combination of
    client and server configuration parameters.  If TLS is used, TCPS
    should be specified for all network ports and SSL_CERT_REVOCATION
    should be set to REQUIRED.

    SV-76233r2, SV-76239r1, SV-76241r1, SV-76305r4

* Client Nodes *
Status: Medium Risk
Summary:
    Valid node check is not enabled, can accept connections from any
    client. Neither TCP.INVITED_NODES nor TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES is set.
Details:
    TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING is not set (default value = NO). Recommended
        value is YES.
    TCP.INVITED_NODES is not set.
    TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES is not set.
Remarks:
    TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING should be enabled to control which client nodes
    can connect to the database server. Either a whitelist of client
    nodes(IP Address/Hostname/Subnet) allowed to connect
    (TCP.INVITED_NODES) or a blacklist of nodes that are not allowed
    (TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES) may be specified. Configuring both lists is an
    error; only the invited node list will be used in this case.

* SQLNET Banners *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    Connect banners are not fully configured.
Details:
    SEC_USER_AUDIT_ACTION_BANNER is not set. Should be set to a proper
        value.
    SEC_USER_UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS_BANNER is not set. Should be set to a
        proper value.
Remarks:
    These banner messages are used to warn connecting users that
    unauthorized access is not permitted and that their activities may be
    audited.

* Network Listener Configuration *
Status: Medium Risk
Summary:
    Examined 1 listener. Found 1 listener not configured properly.
Details:
    Listeners not configured properly: LISTENER

    Parameter setting for LISTENER:
    ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS_LISTENER is not set (default value = OFF).
        Recommended value is ON.
    DYNAMIC_REGISTRATION_LISTENER is not set (default value = ON).
        Recommended value is OFF.
    VALID_NODE_CHECKING_REGISTRATION_LISTENER is not set (default value =
        OFF). Should not be set to OFF.
    SECURE_PROTOCOL_LISTENER is not set.
    SECURE_CONTROL_LISTENER is not set.
    SECURE_REGISTER_LISTENER is not set.

    CONNECTION_RATE_LISTENER is not set.

Remarks:
    These parameters are used to limit changes to the network listener
    configuration. ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS should be enabled to prevent
    parameter changes to the running listener. One of the following
    restrictions on service registration should be implemented: (a) prevent
    changes by disabling DYNAMIC_REGISTRATION, (b) limit the nodes that can
    make changes by enabling VALID_NODE_CHECKING_REGISTRATION, or (c) limit
    the network sources for changes using the COST parameters
    SECURE_PROTOCOL, SECURE_CONTROL, and SECURE_REGISTER. CONNECTION_RATE
    determines rate enforced across all the endpoints that are rate
    limited.

* Listener Logging Control *
Status: Pass
Summary:
    Examined 1 listener. Found 0 listener not configured properly.
Details:
    Listeners configured properly: LISTENER

    Parameter setting for LISTENER:
    LOGGING_LISTENER is not set (default value = ON).
Remarks:
    This parameter enables logging of listener activity. Log information
    can be useful for troubleshooting and to provide early warning of
    attempted attacks.

### Operating System ###

* OS Authentication *
Status: Evaluate
Summary:
    2 OS users can connect to the database via OS authentication.
Details:
    SYSDBA [dba group]: oracle, donghua
    SYSOPER [dba group]: oracle, donghua
    SYSBACKUP [dba group]: oracle, donghua
    SYSKM [dba group]: oracle, donghua
    SYSDG [dba group]: oracle, donghua
    SYSRAC [dba group]: oracle, donghua
Remarks:
    OS authentication allows operating system users within the specified
    user group to connect to the database with administrative privileges
    without any further authentication. This shows the OS group names and
    users that can exercise each administrative privilege. OS users with
    administrative privileges should be reviewed to prevent any
    unauthorized, malicious or unintentional access to the database.

    ORACLE_HOME owner.
Details:
    PMON process: ora_pmon_orcl, Owner: oracle
    ORACLE_HOME owner: oracle

    Other PMON processes found:
            Owner: oracle, Command: asm_pmon_+ASM
Remarks:
    The PMON process monitors user processes and frees resources when they
    terminate. This process should run with the user ID of the ORACLE_HOME
    owner.
References:

* Agent Processes *
Status: Low Risk
Summary:
    Some Agent process owners overlap with Listener or PMON process owners.
Details:
    Owner: oracle
    Command: /u01/grid/bin/oraagent.bin

    Owner: oracle
    Command: /u01/grid/bin/cssdagent
Remarks:
    Agent processes are used by Oracle Enterprise Manager to monitor and
    manage the database. These processes should run with a user ID separate
    from the database and listener processes.

* Listener Processes *
Status: Low Risk
Summary:
    Found 1 Listener process. Some Listener process are owned byAgent or
    PMON process owners.
Details:
    Owner: oracle
    Command: /u01/grid/bin/tnslsnr LISTENER -no_crs_notify -inheritSecurity
        for Listener not set to Local OS Authentication.
Remarks:
    Listener processes accept incoming network connections and connect them
    to the appropriate database server process. These processes should run
    with a user ID separate from the database and agent processes. These
    processes should be administered only through local OS authentication.

Remarks:
    The ORACLE_HOME directory and its subdirectories contain files that are
    critical to the correct operation of the database, including executable
    programs, libraries, data files, and configuration files. Operating
    system file permissions must not allow these files to be modified by
    users other than the ORACLE_HOME owner and must not allow other users
    to directly read the contents of Oracle data files.
