For ease of deployment and compatibility, Oracle Database servers and clients are set to ACCEPT encrypted connections out of the box. This means that you can enable the desired encryption and integrity settings for a connection pair by configuring just one side of the connection, server-side or client-side. So, for example, if there are many Oracle clients connecting to an Oracle database instance, you can configure the required encryption and integrity settings for all these connections by making the appropriate sqlnet.ora changes at the server end. You do not need to implement configuration changes for each client separately. However, in this case, the risk of having plaintext data passed over the network still exists.
